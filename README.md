# Panopto Caption Extractor - Working Solution

A comprehensive solution for extracting captions from Panopto videos, with multiple working methods and deployment options.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Use the Standalone HTML Tool (Recommended)

1. **Open the HTML file directly in your browser:**
   - Download `panopto-caption-proxy.html` 
   - Open it in any modern web browser
   - No server setup required!

2. **Choose your extraction method:**
   - **Bookmarklet Method** (Recommended): Drag the bookmarklet to your bookmarks bar, then use it on any Panopto video page
   - **Manual Console Method**: Copy and paste the provided script into your browser's console

### Option 2: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

1. **Fork this repository** or create a new one with these files
2. **Connect to Cloudflare Pages:**
   - Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → Workers & Pages → Create application → Pages → Connect to Git
   - Select your repository
   - Build settings:
     - Framework preset: `None` (Static HTML)
     - Build command: `echo "No build required"`
     - Build output directory: `/` (root)
   - Deploy!

3. **Your tool will be live** at `https://your-project-name.pages.dev`

## 🔧 How It Works

### The Problem
Panopto videos require authentication and have strict CORS policies that prevent direct browser-based extraction. Our solution provides multiple working methods:

### Method 1: Bookmarklet (Most Reliable)
- Runs directly in the Panopto page context
- Bypasses CORS restrictions
- Uses your authenticated session
- Extracts from `window.PanoptoViewer` and `window.Panopto` objects
- Falls back to DOM scraping if needed

### Method 2: Manual Console Script
- Copy-paste script for browser console
- Same extraction logic as bookmarklet
- Useful when bookmarklet doesn't work

### Method 3: Server-Side Proxy (Experimental)
- Attempts server-side extraction
- May work for some public videos
- Falls back to manual methods if authentication required

## 📁 File Structure

```

├── public/
│   └── index.html          # Main HTML tool
├── server.js               # Express server (optional)

## 🛠️ Local Development

If you want to run the server locally:

## 🎯 Usage Instructions

### For QUB Panopto Videos:

1. **Go to your Panopto video** (e.g., https://qub.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=...)
2. **Sign in** with your QUB credentials
3. **Use the bookmarklet** or **console script** to extract captions
4. **Copy the transcript** and use it in your study guide creator

### For Other Panopto Instances:

The same methods work for any Panopto instance. Just make sure you're signed in to that instance.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "No captions found"
- Ensure the video has captions enabled
- Try refreshing the page and running the extraction again

- Try the manual console method instead
- Check browser console for error messages
